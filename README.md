# Matlab-LSTM-Variational-Autoencoder-and-anomaly-detection


Matlab LSTM Variational Autoencoder do detect anomalies in time series data.
This repositry contains the code used for the my masters thesis (https://online.unileoben.ac.at/mu_online/wbAbs.showThesis?pThesisNr=75598&pOrgNr=1)

$ git clone https://github.com/stefanherdy/Matlab-LSTM-Variational-Autoencoder-and-anomaly-detection.git
```
# Usage

This repository contains only some code of my masters thesis. The data and some functions of the used library are not available, because the project was a company project and therefore the publication of the data and some methods is prohibited.
The main part of this repository, that is of interest for the community, is the developed LSTM_VAE for outlier detection (VAE_Outl_LSTM.m)
